CredentialMemoryStore definitions.  This store is not coupled with any
authentication scheme, so we could define diferent credentials here insted of username and password.


        This sample user information is used by the acegi contacts sample application.

        Passwords encoded using MD5, NOT in Base64 format, with null as salt

        Encoded password for marissa is "koala"
        Encoded password for dianne is "emu"
        Encoded password for scott is "wombat"
        Encoded password for peter is "opal" (but user is disabled)
        Encoded password for bill is "wombat"
        Encoded password for bob is "wombat"
        Encoded password for jane is "wombat"
